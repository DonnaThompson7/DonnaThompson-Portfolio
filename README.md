## Agile requirements:
### User Story

```
  AS AN employer
  I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
  SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
  GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
  WHEN I load their portfolio
  THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
  WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
  THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
  WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
  THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
  WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
  THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
  WHEN I click on the images of the applications
  THEN I am taken to that deployed application
  WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
  THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
